# Invis_Ring
Automatically wear invis ring when fight ends and stats ring when fight starts. For Easier CPs and GQs.

# Syntax
iring [on|off]: Toggle or set autmated actions, essentially enabling/disabling the plugin.

iring id &lt;id&gt;: Set the id of your ring of invisibility. Identify it to get this number. This must be done before the plugin will do anything.

NOTE: This is intended to work with conservative command usage during CPs and the likes. It is best to turn it off when you'll be spamming attacks carelessly (especially in a group!) to avoid spam and possible malfunction.
